								<p class="impact__text">Many villages in the eastern and southern regions of Ukraine
									have been cut off from the rest of the country due to their dangerous location near
									the front lines of the ongoing conflict. This means that the people living there are
									often unable to secure access to food, hygienic products, medicine and other basic
									items. Every week, we drive vans full of boxes of food, clothing and other supplies
									across the country to try to meet their needs.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li class="impact__item">
								<p class="impact__text">However, it is not just these rural communities who have been
									adversely affected. Currently, we have located two hospitals in the regions of
									Kharkiv and Donbas who treat civilians from nearby villages as well as soldiers who
									have been wounded on the front lines. However, these hospitals struggle to acquire
									the necessary medicine and basic medical supplies to treat their patients. We have
									made it a priority to bring these items that they desperately need. Over the last
									few months, we have been regularly delivering medicine, clothing, and even
									ambulances to these hospitals.
